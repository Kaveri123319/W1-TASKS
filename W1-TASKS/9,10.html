    <!-- Section Hierarchy using Headings -->
    <h1>Main Heading (h1)</h1>
    <p>This is the main heading of the page, typically used for the primary title or topic.</p>

    <h2>Subheading Level 1 (h2)</h2>
    <p>This is a subheading, used to introduce a subsection within the main topic.</p>

    <h3>Subheading Level 2 (h3)</h3>
    <p>This is a more specific subsection, providing additional details about the previous topic.</p>

    <h4>Subheading Level 3 (h4)</h4>
    <p>This level further breaks down the content for more detailed explanation.</p>

    <h5>Subheading Level 4 (h5)</h5>
    <p>This heading is used for even more specific sections, usually within a narrower context.</p>

    <h6>Subheading Level 5 (h6)</h6>
    <p>This is the lowest level of heading, typically used for very detailed information.</p>

    <!-- Paragraph Section with Multiple Paragraphs -->
    <h2>Paragraph Section</h2>
    <p>This is the first paragraph in the section. Paragraphs are useful for dividing content into smaller, readable sections.</p>
    <p>This is the second paragraph, and we will add a line break here for demonstration.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now, this is the third paragraph. We used the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag to separate paragraphs within the section.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Finally, this is the fourth paragraph. Using line breaks allows us to create space between specific paragraphs without creating new sections.</p>
